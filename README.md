THE CONCEPT
Every time you START the game, the computer is going to generate a random number from 1 - 20, which is stored in the mystery box.
your job is to guess the number within 5 tries. for every wrong guess, 1 point is deducted(subtracted) from the initial score of 5.

try to achieve the highest score possible. if the initial score(5) becomes 0, then you are lost. 
thankyou so much for taking a look at this project.

I HOPE YOU ALL LIKE iT.
